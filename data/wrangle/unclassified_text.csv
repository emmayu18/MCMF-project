This program is ongoing as the one-to-one mentoring relationships are intended to have long-term impact. We ask that all participants commit to the program for a minimum of one year, but many matches stay together longer. BBBS mentoring positively impacts negative effects of poverty and violence and is backed by independently proven, evidence-based youth outcomes -- avoidance of risky, delinquent behaviors; higher aspirations and improved confidence; and educational success. Matches participate in activities together 2-4 times a month for several hours each meeting; these activities have an intentional focus to increase social skills, develop self-esteem, and new interests, further engage students in school, enhance academic performance, and decrease absences from school, and plan for the future. Activities include but are not limited to homework help, reading, engaging in projects linked to key skill development including but not limited to financial literacy, presentation skills, college and career exposure, recreational activities, holiday projects, academic challenges, and community affairs projects.",0,1,0,1

Through paintings, installations, prints, and sculptures, Lind explores his spiritual voyage and healing practices from the African Diaspora, not only of his native Loíza but also stimulated by his imagination. The inclusion of household objects, amulets, and totems bring together the artist’s home and the presence of his hometown of Loíza. The exhibition also features a selection of his serigraph prints that speak of Loíza’s Afro-Caribbean traditions, such as bomba music and dance, which has become emblematic of Puerto Rican culture. Lind is an artist concerned with preservation, Puerto Rico’s African roots with all its history, and with the current tensions due to climate change and gentrification.</p>",1,0,0,1

"784","Emerging Leaders Summer Program","<p>The Concordia Place Emerging Leaders program changes the narrative for teens (ages 13-18 years) each year. Our theory of change is that teens become confident and compassionate leaders with purpose and direction in their lives when engaged in hands-on experiences that build a wide range of life skills. With an ultimate goal to address social inequalities and violence prevention, the program outcomes are to develop and demonstrate leadership skills and abilities, learn healthy decision making strategies, stay in school and pursue post-secondary education opportunities, become fully engaged in and committed to the program, and lastly improve neighborhoods through community and service-learning projects. We partner with Carl Von Linne Chicago Public school to provide the garden growing space they own and generously allow us to implement and maintain the teen garden.</p>",1,0,1,0

If you love reading YA fiction, nonfiction, comics or manga and sharing your thoughts about books through writing, audio and video then this is the internship for you.  

As part of a team of 12 interns you will focus on reading new titles, discussing your opinions and the  evaluations of titles, while learning from teen librarians about the processes of content curation within the library. You will also be unleashing your inner #BookTok-er making book related social media content. 

If you have questions, please email Danielle Becker (dbecker@chipublib.org) or Marshall Caal (mcaal@chipublib.org)

Program Schedule:
The internship will begin on February 11th, and run until December 9th. We will meet every 2nd Saturday and meetings will be 3 hours (10am-1pm).

These meetings will all be in person at YOUmedia HWLC (400 S. State St.). We know that some folx may head off to college out of state in September, so we will offer a hybrid option for the final four meetings of the year.

You are also allocated 16 hours of asynchronous time for the month to read. This should hopefully be enough time for you to get through 2-3 books.

We will also use Discord for communication about reading throughout the course of the internship.

Payment:
The pay rate will be $15/hour. You can set up payment by check or Zelle.
If you are 16+ you will need to submit a completed W9 in order  for payment to be processed.
